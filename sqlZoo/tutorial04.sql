-- To get a well rounded view of the important features of SQL you should move on to the next tutorial concerning aggregates.
-- To gain an absurdly detailed view of one insignificant feature of the language, read on.
-- We can use the word ALL to allow >= or > or < or <=to act over a list. For example, you can find the largest country in the world, by population with this query:
-- SELECT name
--   FROM world
--  WHERE population >= ALL(SELECT population
--                            FROM world
--                           WHERE population>0)
-- You need the condition population>0 in the sub-query as some countries have null for population.
